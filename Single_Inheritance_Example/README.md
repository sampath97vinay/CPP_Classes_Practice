Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP, that allows a class to inherit properties (fields and methods) from another class. 

It enables the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) inherits characteristics
from a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class).

Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of "is-a" relationships. The derived class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the base class, 
thereby extending and specializing its functionality. It allows you to define a more specific class based on a more general class.

Inheritance is of various types: Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Multi-level Inheritance, Hybrid and Heirarchial Inheritance.
This program demonstrates the concept of Single Inheritance. 

The Class 'Manager' is derived from the base class 'Employee'. 
The employee class has attributes like name, salary and a display function, whereas the manager class has an additional attribute called department.
