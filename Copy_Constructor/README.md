Copy constructor is a special member function of a class that is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object of the same class type.

When a copy constructor is invoked, a replica of an already existing object is created, which can be used to access the member variables and member functions 
of the class.

The example code demonstrates this concept where the first object is initialized with the name 'John' and age '30'. The copy constructor is used to create a copy 
of this object, and later these attributes are changed to 'Mark' and '30'.
